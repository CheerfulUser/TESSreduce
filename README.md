With this package that builds on lightkurve, you can reduce TESS data while preserving transient signals. You can supply a TPF or give coordinates and sector to construct a TPF with TESScut. The background subtraction accounts for the smooth background and
detector straps. Alongisde background subtraction TESSreduce also aligns images, performs difference imaging, and can even detect transient events! 

An additional component that is in development is calibration of TESS photometry, and reliably link muti-sector light curves.

TESSreduce can be installed through pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/CheerfulUser/TESSreduce.git`

Example reduction for SN 2018fub:
```python
import tessreduce as tr
obs = tr.sn_lookup('sn2018fub')
```
```
|   Sector | Covers   |   Time difference  |
|          |          |             (days) |
|----------+----------+--------------------|
|        2 | True     |                  0 |
|       29 | False    |                721 |
```

```python
tess = tr.tessreduce(obs_list=obs)
```

**OR**
```python
import tessreduce as tr
ra = 10.127
dec = -50.687
sector = 2
tess = tr.tessreduce(ra=ra,dec=dec,sector=sector)
```

If you have a downloaded TPF you can load that directly into tessreduce.
```python
tess = tr.tessreduce(tpf='file')
```


# Photometry method

TESSreduce can perform aperture and PSF photometry. The photometry method used is set by the `phot_method` option which can either be `aperture` or `psf`. In general the PSF method appears to be more robust, however, there are cases where aperture still provides a better lightcurve. The default method is `aperture`. Using the example above we can use different photometry methods as follows.

```python
tess = tr.tessreduce(obs_list=obs,phot_method='psf') # runs PSF photometry for reduction
tess = tr.tessreduce(obs_list=obs,phot_method='aperture') # runs aperture photometry for reduction
```
You can also define the photometry method when creating a lightcurve with `diff_lc` as follows.
```python
lc, sky = tess.diff_lc(phot_method='psf')
```

The PRF photometry method uses the TESS_PRF package which can be found here: https://github.com/keatonb/TESS_PRF

# Flux calibration

TESSreduce can calibrate TESS counts to physical flux, or AB magnitudes, by using PS1 data, If your field is dec >-30, and SkyMapper data for Southern field. IF you want a flux calibrated light curve then use:
```python
tess.to_flux()
```
**OR**
```python
tess.to_mag()
```
Several options are available for flux and are interchangeable, however, mag is currently not reversible. To easily plot the resulting light curve:
```python
tess.plotter()
```

# Extracting key variables 

The main variables that TESSreduce assigns during the reduction can be accessed as follows:
- flux: tess.flux 
- background: tess.bkg
- reference: tess.ref
- reference index: tess.ref_ind
- lightcurve: tess.lc
- Mask: tess.mask
- Source catalog: tess.cat


There are a lot of other functions burried in TESSreduce, so if you want some guidence on how to do a specific analysis contact me at: ryan.ridden@canterbury.ac.nz
